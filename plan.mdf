**PROJECT PROPOSAL**

Internal Ship-Package Tracking & Logistics Management System

*Version 2.0*

# 1. Executive Summary

The company proposes the development of an internal Ship-Package Tracking & Logistics Management System to manage the full operational lifecycle of customer packages transported between international warehouses (Lebanon and Gabon) using shared shipment containers.

The system will be used exclusively by company employees and will centralize logistics operations currently handled through manual processes, spreadsheets, and messaging applications. The solution will provide full traceability, pricing control, documentation compliance, and operational efficiency across all warehouses and shipment cycles.

# 2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Track customer packages from origin warehouse to destination warehouse

1. Consolidate packages from multiple customers into shared shipment containers

1. Enforce structured package classification, documentation, and pricing rules

1. Ensure accurate photo evidence at every warehouse stage with customer identification

1. Automate container sequencing and package allocation

1. Enforce container capacity control (weight & m²) with configurable warnings

1. Generate invoices, packing lists, and Excel reports per customer

1. Support bilingual product catalog (Arabic/English) with stored pricing

1. Track vessel movement and provide estimated arrival dates

1. Handle additional fees (port charges, internal transport)

1. Improve coordination between warehouses in different countries

1. Reduce operational risk, errors, and disputes

1. Enable scalable, repeatable shipment operations year over year

-   Operations Staff (Destination Warehouse - Gabon)

-   Logistics Management

-   Finance Team

## 4.2 External Warehouse Access (Optional)

The system may be extended to external warehouse partners with limited permissions if they have the capability to enter information directly. Otherwise, coordination continues through existing communication channels with manual data entry by internal staff.

Customers and suppliers do not access the system directly.

# 5. Operational Workflow

## 5.1 Customer Registration & Initial Booking

1. Customer calls to book shipment

1. Staff enters preliminary (approximate) information into the system

1. System automatically assigns a permanent unique customer ID

1. Customer name and phone number are recorded

1. Staff can print or share price list with customer manually

## 5.2 Goods Receipt at Origin Warehouse

1. When goods arrive at the warehouse, staff enters accurate/final information

1. Photos of the goods are taken and attached to the record

1. Customer name is automatically overlaid on photos for identification

1. Goods type is selected from bilingual catalog (Arabic name auto-translates to English)

1. System suggests default pricing based on goods type (with stored discounted prices if applicable)

1. Weight and m² measurements are recorded

1. Compliance documents are auto-generated based on goods type

1. Documents are printed for customer signature (responsibility declaration, drug-free certification)

1. Signed documents are scanned/photographed and uploaded to the system

## 5.3 Container Assignment & Loading

1. Confirmed packages are assigned to the oldest Pending container

1. Draft packages are assigned to the next available Pending container

1. System continuously tracks total weight and m² against container limits

1. Visual warnings displayed when approaching capacity threshold (configurable: 80-90%)

1. Container status changes to 'Nearly Full' when threshold is reached

1. Assignment prevented if it would exceed container limits

1. All assignments and reassignments are logged

## 5.4 Pre-Shipment Documentation

Once goods are ready for loading, the system generates per customer:

-   Photo album with all goods photos (each photo labeled with customer name)

-   Signed compliance documents

-   Goods type and classification

-   Shipping price breakdown

-   Agreement document ready for customer

## 5.5 Vessel Tracking & Updates

-   Staff enters vessel name and tracking information

-   Estimated departure and arrival dates are recorded

-   Staff can add weekly updates on vessel location/status

-   Updates are logged with timestamps

-   Staff can manually notify customers of updates via their preferred channel

## 5.6 Document Generation

The system generates:

-   Packing List - complete inventory of container contents

-   Commercial Invoice - with reduced/declared prices for customs (entered once per product, then stored for future use)

-   Customer Invoice - actual shipping charges with any additional fees

## 5.7 Destination Warehouse Operations (Gabon)

1. Staff has full access to shipment data, customer information, and all photos

1. Photos are labeled with customer names for easy identification during unloading

1. Staff can view signed documents and goods classifications

# 7. ShipmentContainer Sequencing & Capacity Control

## 7.1 Container Capacity Limits

Each ShipmentContainer must define:

-   Alerts displayed on dashboard for logistics management

**Business Value:** Prevents overloading and allows proactive shipment planning.

## 7.3 Container Status Lifecycle
